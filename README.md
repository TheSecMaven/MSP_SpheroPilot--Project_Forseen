Week 1: I received my Sphero 2.0 on Thursday. I have had a few days now to get acquainted with it and I am excited to start working with it! I have downloaded the Sphero 2.0 Win.NET SDK and I will be looking over it and utilizing it as I begin to work on this project. The complexity of this will provide a great challenge for me seeing as I am relatively new to all that computer science and coding have to offer. Nonetheless, I can't wait to see what I can do with this! #ImagineThis
