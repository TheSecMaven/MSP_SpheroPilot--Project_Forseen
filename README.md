Week 1: I received my Sphero 2.0 on Thursday. I have had a few days now to get acquainted with it and I am excited to start working with it! I have downloaded the Sphero 2.0 Win.NET SDK and I will be looking over it and utilizing it as I begin to work on this project. The complexity of this will provide a great challenge for me seeing as I am relatively new to all that computer science and coding have to offer. Nonetheless, I can't wait to see what I can do with this! #ImagineThis

Week 2: The Sphero has proven to be a difficult adversary. I had a lot of issues with beginning to understand and work with it through Visual Studio 2015. The most difficult thing is and will be understanding and utilizing the SDK for Sphero 2.0. I am still working on the logic necessary to go through the maze. It is not so much the actual manner in which I will go through a maze so much as getting it to actually do it and then also remember which direction it went so that it can return directions through that same maze. Because we are developing this as a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) app it will work on any device, which also will make it easier on my end. My next job is to implement the logic for the Sphero and continue to better my understanding in doing so.
